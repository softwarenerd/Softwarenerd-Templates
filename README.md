Objective-C File Templates

This small project contains some useful Objective-C file templates for the style of iOS programming I use frequently. It favors hand-coded views and view controllers over Interface Builder, and fully-encapsulated implementationd details. I've mainly created this project for myself. If you find it useful, that's fun. Feel free to use these as you see fit.

To install, use the install.sh script:

```
sh install.sh
```

This will ensure that ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates exists (it generally won't), and then create a symbolic link to this folder in that location called Softwarenerd.

To uninstall, use the uninstall.sh script:

```
sh uninstall.sh
```

This will remove the symbolic link to this folder, if it exists.

Please feel free to get in touch with any comments, thoughts, etc.
