Objective-C File Templates

This small project contains some useful Objective-C file templates for the style of iOS programming I use frequently. It favors hand-coded views and view controllers over Interface Builder, and fully-encapsulated implementationd details.

Feel free to use these in your own projects.

To install these file in the right place, use the install.sh script.

'sh install.sh'

This will ensure that ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates exists, and then create a symbolic link to this folder in that location called Softwarenerd.

Feel free to get in touch with any comments, thoughts, etc.
